# function-rocke-unannotated
This task included counting the number of proteins wiht no annotation (so KEGG, GO or PFAM) accross the various HS039 analyses, and plotting the %unannotated (of total proteins) according to various metadata categories. The dataframe used to plot these graphs is loaded as "HS039a.txt".
